Description: Python interface to the networkmanager D-Bus interface
 python-networkmanager wraps NetworkManagers D-Bus interface so you can be less
 verbose when talking to NetworkManager from python. All interfaces have been
 wrapped in classes, properties are exposed as python properties and function
 calls are forwarded to the correct interface.
